  Abstract                 = {In this survey, receding horizon control is presented as a method for obtaining approximately optimal solutions to infinite horizon optimal control problems by iteratively solving a sequence of finite horizon optimal control problems. We investigate conditions under which we can obtain mathematically rigorous approximation results for this approach. A key ingredient of our analysis is the so-called turnpike property of optimal control problems.},
